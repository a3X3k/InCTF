Invisible ink is an example of steganography that is unrelated to computers. 
A person can write a message with clear or "invisible" ink that can only be seen when another ink or liquid is applied to the paper. 
Similarly, in digital steganography, the goal is to hide information from users except those who are meant to see or hear it.
