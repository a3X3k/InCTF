### Chall Description

### Hints

- No use of Stegsnow :)
- You can send your secret messages in twitter.
- One of the two or more characters appear identical or very similar.

### Solution

- This challenge is based on **Homoglyphs Steganography** which can be used to hide secret messages in twitter tweets (or any text).

Invisible ink is an example of steganography that is unrelated to computers. 
A person can write a message with clear or "invisible" ink that can only be seen when another ink or liquid is applied to the paper. 
Similarly, in digital steganography, the goal is to hide information from users except those who are meant to see or hear it.

- [Decoding](https://holloway.nz/steg/) it gives the flag.
