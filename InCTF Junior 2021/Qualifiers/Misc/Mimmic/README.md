### Hints

- No use of Stegsnow :)
- Your flag has been encoded into something which looks innocent.
- Decode the message from Spam-Encoded.

### Solution

- From the challenge name and hints its evident that the secret message is given as spam.
- [Decoding](https://www.spammimic.com/decodespace.shtml) the space and tab enclosed characters gives the [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/embed_js/0sHZNAj2) link which has the flag.
